    "Question": "What is polymorphism and how is it implemented in OOP?",
    "Answer": "Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as a common type. It\u0027s implemented through method overriding and interfaces, enabling methods to behave differently based on the object.",

    "Answer": "Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit or class, restricting access to certain components. It protects object integrity and promotes modular, maintainable code.",
